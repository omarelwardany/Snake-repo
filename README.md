# The Snake
This is the ancient snake game, made into the *Windows* console

## **How to get the game**

- You can compile the game yourself

    - clone the repository using this command
        > git clone https://github.com/omarelwardany/Snake-repo.git
    - compile `snake.cpp` using a c++ compiler, I used clang

- You can also download the latest release binary [here](https://github.com/omarelwardany/Snake-repo/releases)

  - **Note**: Your browser and antivirus will make your life hard if you try to download the exe, make sure to bypass all the warning messages **OR** compile it yourself


## **How to play**
1. When you run the game, you will be prompted to choose between 2 difficulty levels
    - **Easy**: This difficulty level allows you to teleport through the map borders
    - **Hard**: Hitting the borders will kill you
2. Press **E** on your keyboard to choose **Easy**, and **H** for **Hard**
3. Control the snake using the **WASD** keys
4. Eat the fruits (symbolized by `@`) to increase the length of the snake
5. Keep growing and avoid dying
6. When you die, you will be prompted to choose between three options, using the **R**, **C** and **Q** keys
    - **Retry**: Resets the snake length and restarts the game
    - **Continue**: Restarts the game without resetting snake length
    - **Quit**: This one is self explanatory, it closes the game window
